TeleSign Web Services: Ruby SDK
---------------------------------

**TeleSign web services** conform to the `REST Web Service Design Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_. Services are exposed as URI-addressable resources through the set of *RESTful* procedures in our **TeleSign REST API**.

The **TeleSign Ruby SDK** is a set of software development toolsâ€”a *Ruby Library* that wraps the TeleSign REST API, and it simplifies TeleSign application development in the `Ruby programming language <https://www.ruby-lang.org/>`_. The SDK software is packaged as a Ruby gem called **telesign**, and is distributed using `Ruby Gems <https://rubygems.org/>`_.

The Ruby Classes
------------------

With just two classes, **Telesign::API** abstracts much of the complexity of the TeleSign REST API.

+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ruby Class                | Description                                                              |
+===========================+==========================================================================+
| Telesign::API::PhoneId    | The **PhoneId** class exposes four services that each provide            |
|                           | information about a specified phone number.                              |
|                           |                                                                          |
|                           | *standard*                                                               |
|                           |     Retrieves the standard set of details about the specified phone      |
|                           |     number. This includes the type of phone (for example, land line or   |
|                           |     mobile), and its approximate geographic location.                    |
|                           | *score*                                                                  |
|                           |     Retrieves a score for the specified phone number. This ranks the     |
|                           |     phone number's "risk level" on a scale from 0 to 1000, so you can    |
|                           |     code your web application to handle particular use cases (for        |
|                           |     example, to stop things like chargebacks, identity theft, fraud, and |
|                           |     spam).                                                               |
|                           | *contact*                                                                |
|                           |     In addition to the information retrieved by *standard*, this service |
|                           |     provides the name and address associated with the specified phone    |
|                           |     number.                                                              |
|                           | *live*                                                                   |
|                           |     In addition to the information retrieved by *standard*, this service |
|                           |     provides actionable data associated with the specified phone number. |
|                           | *number_deactivation*                                                    |
|                           |     In addition to the information retrieved by *standard*, this service |
|                           |     provides information on number deactivation for the phone number     |
|                           |     provided.                                                            |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Telesign::API::Verify     | The **Verify** class exposes five services for sending users a           |
|                           | verification token (a three to five-digit number). You can use this      |
|                           | mechanism to test whether you can reach users at the phone number        |
|                           | they supplied, or you can have them use the token to authenticate        |
|                           | themselves with your web application. In addition, this class also       |
|                           | exposes a service that allows you to confirm the result of the           |
|                           | authentication.                                                          |
|                           |                                                                          |
|                           | You can use this verification factor in combination with *username*      |
|                           | and *password* to provide *two-factor* authentication for higher         |
|                           | security.                                                                |
|                           |                                                                          |
|                           | *call*                                                                   |
|                           |     Calls the specified phone number and uses speech synthesis to speak  |
|                           |     the verification code to the user.                                   |
|                           | *sms*                                                                    |
|                           |     Sends a text message containing the verification code to the         |
|                           |     specified phone number (supported for mobile phones only).           |
|                           | *smart*                                                                  |
|                           |     Smart intelligently determines the best service to use based on      |
|                           |     the end user device and then attempts to place a call, send an SMS,  |
|                           |     or send a push request.                                              |
|                           | *push*                                                                   |
|                           |     Sends a push notification containing the verification code to the    |
|                           |     specified phone number (supported for registered devices only).      |
|                           | *status*                                                                 |
|                           |     Retrieves the verification result. You make this call in your web    |
|                           |     application after users complete the authentication transaction      |
|                           |     (using either a *call* or *sms*).                                    |
|                           |                                                                          |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Telesign::API::TeleBureau | The **Telebureau** class exposes services for creating, retrieving,      |
|                           | updating and deleting telebureau fraud events. You can use this          |
|                           | mechanism to test whether you can reach Telebureau services.             |
|                           |                                                                          |

|                           |    Creates a Telebureau event corresponding to supplied data.            |

|                           |    Retrieves the fraud event status. You make this call in your web      |
|                           |    application after completion of create/update transaction for a       |
|                           |    Telebureau event.                                                     |

|                           |    Deletes a previously submitted fraud event. You make this call in     |
|                           |    your web application after completion of submit/update transaction    |
|                           |    for a Telebureau event.                                               |

    verify = Telesign::API::Verify.new(cust_id, secret_key) # Instantiate a Verify instance object,
    result = verify.call(phone_number) # and use it to call the "call" method.
    p result.body

    {"reference_id"=>"254CADA5F1D40E0090405467DE244D05", "resource_uri"=>"/v1/verify/254CADA5F1D40E0090405467DE244D05", "sub_resource"=>"call", "errors"=>[], "verify"=>{"code_state"=>"UNKNOWN", "code_entered"=>""}, "status"=>{"updated_on"=>"2016-02-29T05:04:06.814381Z", "code"=>103, "description"=>"Call in progress"}}
